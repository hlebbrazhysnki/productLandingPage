    RM-Z450 epitomizes Suzuki's “Winning Balance” philosophy of "RUN, TURN, and STOP" with strong brakes for controlled stopping power, a wide spread of engine muscle with high peak power, and a strong, light, and more nimble chassis that remains the class standard for cornering performance.

    Performance never looked so good, or so dark. The Suzuki Boulevard C90 B.O.S.S. rewards you with a striking combination of blacked out styling and heart-pounding performance, thanks to its 90 cubic inch, fuel injected, V-twin engine. Along with the aggressive Blacked Out Special Suzuki (B.O.S.S.) styling and stunning performance, this bike features a spacious riding position and large floorboards for comfortable cruising, matched by precise, agile handling provided by its rigid chassis and advanced suspension.
